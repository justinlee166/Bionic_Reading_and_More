## 🎯 About the Project

### 📖 Making Reading More Accessible
Reading should be an inclusive experience for everyone, yet millions of people face challenges due to dyslexia, ADHD, and other reading difficulties. Our team set out to build a Bionic Reading extension and a dyslexia-friendly font customization tool to help users read more comfortably and efficiently.

### 💡 The Problem
People with dyslexia often find it difficult to focus on large passages of text, as words can blur together or feel overwhelming. Similarly, individuals with ADHD may struggle to maintain focus while reading. Unfortunately, most websites do not offer built-in accessibility features to accommodate these challenges.

### 🚀 Our Solution
Our project enhances digital reading experiences by introducing:
- Bionic Reading Mode – Dynamically bolds parts of words to guide the eyes and improve focus.
- Dyslexia-Friendly Font Customization – Allows users to adjust fonts, sizes, and spacing for better readability.
- Seamless Web Integration – Works across different websites without disrupting content layout.

### 🔧 How It Works
We developed this project using HTML, CSS, and JSON, leveraging Google’s extension framework to create a lightweight and efficient browser extension. With a single click, users can activate Bionic Reading mode or customize fonts to suit their needs.

## 🏗 Challenges & Learnings
### 💡 Challenges Faced

- Performance Optimization – Processing large amounts of text without slowing down content-heavy pages was a challenge that required optimizing our code.
- Text Manipulation Complexity – Implementing Bionic Reading required dynamically bolding parts of words while preserving proper formatting across various websites
- Cross-Browser Compatibility – Ensuring that our extension worked across different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge) required adjustments in styling and JavaScript execution
### 📚 What We Learned
- The Importance of Accessibility – Hearing firsthand how dyslexia affects reading helped us understand the real-world impact of inclusive design.
- Efficient Text Processing – We learned how to manipulate DOM elements efficiently while preventing performance issues.
- How Chrome Extensions Work – Gaining hands-on experience with Google’s Chrome Extension API taught us about content scripts, permissions, and handling user preferences.
